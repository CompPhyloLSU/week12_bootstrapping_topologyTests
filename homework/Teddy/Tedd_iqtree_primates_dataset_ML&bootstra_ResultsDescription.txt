###Description of ML and bootstrap analyses for primates dataset in iqtree
#Results
-I ran my ML analysis on iqtree using this statement:
$iqtree -s primates_and_galeopterus_cytb.nex -pre ML

iqtree tested 281 models and chose Best-fit model: TIM2+F+I+G4 chosen according to BIC
for ML analysis. Then after running for a few minutes (2-3 min) it returned
the log and tree files for that analysis

I observed the ML tree produced on iqtree and looked different than the one created
in revBayes

-I ran my bootstrap support analysis on iqtree using this statement:
$iqtree -s ./primates_and_galeopterus_cytb.nex -m TIM2+F+I+G4 -b 200 -pre primates_and_galeopterus_cytb.nex.boot
*The TIM2+F+I+G4 allowed our bootstrap support analysis to run using the model selected in our previous step 
using the Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC)

iqtree ran for about 20 min and returned the log and tree files corresponding to 200 searches using
a non-parametric bootstrap support search.

The bootstrap support values were in the primates_and_galeopterus_cytb.nex.boot.treefile
and I was able to observe them in figtree. The lowest support value mapped on the tree was 24
