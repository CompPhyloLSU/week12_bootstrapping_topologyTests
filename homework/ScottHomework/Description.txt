Performing model selection through IQTree finds the best fit model for AIC, AICc, and BIC. AIC and BIC are information criteria which use
penalties for additional parameters to find the best model. AICc is the correction for small sample sizes for AIC.  AIC and AICc finds the best model 
to be GTR+F+R4. The model name breaks down as the following:
GTR - time reversible model with unequal rates of change and base frequencies 
F - empirical base frequencies 
R4 - freerate model which relaxes the assumptions of the gamma distribution with four categories 

Once the model has been selected the maximum likelihood tree can be found. Performing bootstrapping with 200 repetitions allows for 
repeatable trees to be found, which helps find the majority consensus tree. If you compare the unbootstrapped and bootstrapped trees, you 
will find that taxa will move across the tree. Branch lengths are included.
