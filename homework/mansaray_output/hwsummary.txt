#I used the tutorial site for help http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Tutorial
#worked on command line 


#First code to see which model fit the best; used AIC suggestion 
iqtree -s primates_and_galeopterus_cytb.nex -m MFP

#Model Suggestions 
Akaike Information Criterion:           GTR+F+R4
Corrected Akaike Information Criterion: GTR+F+R4
Bayesian Information Criterion:         TIM2+F+I+G4
Best-fit model: TIM2+F+I+G4 chosen according to BIC

#SecondCode

bin/iqtree -s primates_and_galeopterus_cytb.nex -m GTR+F+R4 -b 200 -nt AUTO


#Summary 
Log-likelihood of the tree: -13153.2198 (s.e. 317.7386)
Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -5638.3455
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 57
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 26420.4396
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 26426.7729
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 26705.7178

Total tree length (sum of branch lengths): 5.2729
Sum of internal branch lengths: 1.2406 (23.5278% of tree length)

Though I rooted, the unrooted tree seemed to have high bootstrap support at most of the branches.
Varecia_variegata_variegata  tipped branch had a bootstap support of 31 compared to Propithecus_coquereli tipped branch
which had bootstap support of 100.
