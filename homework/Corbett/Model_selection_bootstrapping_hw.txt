Model Selection and Bootstrapping Homework

The best model selected using AIC was GTR+F+R4, while the best model selected using
BIC was TIM2+F+I+G4. These are both among the most complex and parameter-rich models,
and all of the best supported models could be described as such. The best BIC model was the
fifth-best (out of 203) using AIC. The least supported model was Jukes-Cantor, followed by
F81+F, K2P, and K3P, suggesting that many of the simpler models that we are familiar with
are not sufficient to capture the complexity of the data.

Bootstrap values on the tree vary from 100 down to 31. Many of the nodes without sufficient supported
are those that were challenging in previous analyses as well: the deep relationships between the four main clades
(lemurs, tarsiers, lorises, monkeys and apes), the placement of the aye-aye, and some of the other branches
within lemurs and new world monkeys. Overall the bootstrap gives us a good sense of which nodes are very solid,
and for which nodes there is not enough data to resolve them. I belive the current thinking is that tarsiers
are sister to monkeys and apes, which is not the topology we recover, but we also do not recover a well-supported
topology that conflicts with that.
