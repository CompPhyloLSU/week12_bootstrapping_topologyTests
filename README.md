## Assignments

- Make sure you have identified the dataset and general analysis type that you want to use for your final project.
- Model Selection and Nonparametric Bootstrapping
  - Download and install IQTree
  - Use the same primates dataset you used for the RevBayes exercise on gene-tree inference
  - Perform model selection with AIC and BIC in IQTree and record the models they choose
  - Using the model chosen by AIC, estimate the ML tree for these data and perform non-parametric bootstrapping with 200 replicates
